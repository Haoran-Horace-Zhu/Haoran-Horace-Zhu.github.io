  title={**A generalization of Boole's formula derived from a system of linear equations**.},
  abstract={We analyze a system of linear algebraic equations whose solutions lead to a proof of a generalization of Boole's formula. In particular, our approach provides an elementary and short alternative to Katsuura's proof of this generalization.},

  title={**On an eigenvalue inequality**.},
  abstract={The eigenvalues of the sum of two matrices A and B can be bounded by Weyl's inequality. Using the matrix decomposition technique, tighter bounds on the eigenvalues of the sum of Hermitian matrices are given with some sufficient conditions, which will be useful to compute the energy difference between quantum states or to deal with the spectrum problems.},

@article{Twistcombhopf,
  bibtex_show={true},
  title={(with R. Liu, C. Zhang) **Twisted combinatorial Hopf algebras and their algebraic combinatorial realizations**.},
  abstract={As the BiHom-twisted deformation arises, some classical Q-deformed objects have been
shown as special cases. Motivated by these, we provide a new twisted version of the combinatorial
Hopf algebras, and also give their algebraic and combinatorial constructions, respectively. Specifically,
we endow the BiHom-twisted structure to a graded and connected Hopf algebra, and give a proper
algebraic construction of the tensor product of the twisted combinatorial Hopf algebras, which contains
a proof of the statement about the tensor product of BiHom-associative algebras of G. Graziani, A.
Makhlouf, C. Menini, and F. Panaite generalize the case to bialgebra setting. Applying the new twisting
action, we present a combinatorial realization by reconstructing binary planar trees as an example.
Finally, we conclude with some open problems for future research.},

We establish a correspondence between solutions of the general normal equation and its dual equation. Explicit solutions are described for the two-dimensional case.},

Additionally, the linear morphisms between infinite-dimensional Hom-algebras (resp. Hom-modules) and Hom-coalgebras (resp. Hom-comodules) are derived under this construction.},

@article{Orepolynomial,

  title={(with R. Liu, C. Zhang) **Deformations of Ore extensions and (p,q)-Weyl algebras**.},
  abstract={We obtain a BiHom deformed version of the Ore extension which takes into account the absence of a unit element and the associative properties. This gener- alises previous results of Ore and Back-Richter-Silvestrov. We also provide an exam- ple of a (p,q)-type Weyl algebra to show that the BiHom-Ore extension approach can prepare us for future realisations of new deformations of quantum algebras. As a by-product, we provide some corrections in the literature about the existence of (Bi)Hom quantum plane and (Bi)Hom universal enveloping algebras via Ore extensions.},
